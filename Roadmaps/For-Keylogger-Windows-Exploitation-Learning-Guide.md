# Windows Exploitation Learning Guide & Keylogger Development Roadmap

## **ðŸ”¥ Comprehensive Guide to Learning Windows Security & Exploitation**
This guide provides an **advanced**, **in-depth**, and **book-length** method to mastering **Windows internals, security mechanisms, exploitation techniques, and keylogger development**.

The **end goal** is to develop a **stealthy, persistent, and advanced keylogger** while mastering **Windows security, process injection, API hooking, kernel manipulation, and evasion techniques**.

Every section includes **step-by-step guidance on how to learn**, **real-world attack scenarios**, and **deep technical insights** to ensure mastery.

## **ðŸ“Œ Part 1: Setting Up a Windows Exploitation Lab**
Before we dive into Windows Internals, we must establish a controlled environment for testing and debugging.

### **Task 1: Setting Up a Research Lab**
1. **Install VMware/VirtualBox** and set up a **Windows 10 Virtual Machine**.
2. **Disable Windows Defender & Firewall** to prevent security interference:
   ```powershell
   Set-MpPreference -DisableRealtimeMonitoring $true
   netsh advfirewall set allprofiles state off
   ```
3. **Install Debugging & Monitoring Tools**:
   - **Process Explorer & Process Hacker** (To analyze processes & memory usage)
   - **API Monitor** (To track system calls and API interactions)
   - **WinDbg** (To perform deep debugging on Windows internals)
   - **Sysinternals Suite** (Collection of utilities for process, registry, and system monitoring)
4. **Take a VM Snapshot** before any testing to prevent system corruption.

ðŸ“Œ **Why is this necessary?**
- A virtual environment allows you to safely execute and analyze potential malware behaviors.
- Debugging tools are essential for **tracing Windows operations, memory usage, and API hooks**.

## **ðŸ“Œ Part 2: Understanding Windows Process Execution**
To manipulate processes for keylogging, we must first understand how Windows executes them.

### **Task 2: Understanding Windows Process Execution & Privileges**
1. **Launch Process Explorer** and locate `explorer.exe`.
2. **Identify Parent-Child Relationships**:
   - Every process in Windows is spawned by another process.
   - `explorer.exe` launches GUI applications.
   - `cmd.exe` is often launched by `explorer.exe` or other processes.
3. **Examine Security Tokens:**
   - Right-click a process â†’ **Properties â†’ Security Tab**.
   - Each process runs with a security token that determines its permissions.
   - SYSTEM processes have **higher privileges** than user-mode processes.
4. **List Privileges in the Command Line:**
   ```powershell
   whoami /priv
   ```
   - Look for **SeImpersonatePrivilege**, which allows privilege escalation.

ðŸ“Œ **What is happening here?**
- Windows assigns security **tokens** to each process, dictating what actions it can perform.
- SYSTEM-level processes have unrestricted access, while user processes are limited.
- **Privilege escalation exploits weaknesses in these tokens** to elevate access.

## **ðŸ“Œ Part 3: Windows API & System Call Interactions**
Keyloggers rely on **API hooking** to intercept keystrokes. Before we hook APIs, we must understand how Windows processes system calls.

### **Task 3: Understanding Windows API Calls & System Call Flow**
1. **Monitor API Calls Using API Monitor**:
   - Attach API Monitor to `notepad.exe`.
   - Filter for key functions: `CreateFile()`, `ReadProcessMemory()`, `OpenProcess()`.
2. **Understand the Call Stack:**
   - When an application calls a Windows API function (`CreateFile()`), it internally calls an NT API function (`NtCreateFile()`).
   - The NT API function invokes a **system call (`syscall`)** that executes code in **Kernel Mode**.
   - The system call is handled by `ntoskrnl.exe`, which interacts with hardware and returns a result.
3. **Track System Calls in WinDbg:**
   ```powershell
   bp nt!NtCreateFile
   g
   ```
   - This sets a **breakpoint** on `NtCreateFile()`, stopping execution when it is called.
   - When triggered, inspect **registers and memory state**.

ðŸ“Œ **What is happening here?**
- Applications **never communicate directly with the kernel**.
- Instead, they rely on **system calls** that transition execution from **User Mode to Kernel Mode**.
- Keyloggers can **hook API functions** to capture keystrokes before they reach the system call.

## **ðŸ“Œ Part 4: Memory Manipulation & Process Injection**
Advanced keyloggers must **inject code into other processes** to remain hidden.

### **Task 4: Injecting Code into a Running Process**
1. **Allocate Memory in Another Process**:
   - Open `Process Hacker`.
   - Select a target process (`notepad.exe`).
   - Inject memory using **VirtualAllocEx()**:
     ```c
     LPVOID pMemory = VirtualAllocEx(hProcess, NULL, 1024, MEM_COMMIT, PAGE_EXECUTE_READWRITE);
     ```
2. **Write & Execute Shellcode in Remote Process**:
   - Use `WriteProcessMemory()` to write shellcode into allocated memory.
   - Execute shellcode using `CreateRemoteThread()`.
3. **Verify Injection in Process Explorer**:
   - Locate the target process.
   - Check the loaded modules & new memory regions.

ðŸ“Œ **What is happening here?**
- We allocate memory **inside another process**, allowing us to **execute arbitrary code**.
- This technique is used for **stealth keylogging and malware injection**.
- Windows security tools often flag such behavior, so **evasion techniques are required**.

## **ðŸ“Œ Part 5: Writing a Basic Keylogger & Hooking Keystrokes**
Now that we understand Windows internals, we can implement keylogging techniques.

### **Task 5: Hooking Keystrokes Using Windows Hooks**
1. **Register a Keyboard Hook:**
   - Windows provides `SetWindowsHookEx()` to intercept keyboard events.
   - Hook `WH_KEYBOARD_LL` to capture low-level keystrokes:
     ```c
     HHOOK hHook = SetWindowsHookEx(WH_KEYBOARD_LL, KeyboardProc, NULL, 0);
     ```
2. **Process & Log Keystrokes:**
   - Inside `KeyboardProc()`, log `wParam` (keycode).
   - Store key presses into a file.
3. **Ensure Persistence & Evasion:**
   - Modify the registry to start the keylogger at boot:
     ```powershell
     reg add HKCU\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Run /v keylogger /t REG_SZ /d "C:\malicious.exe"
     ```

ðŸ“Œ **What is happening here?**
- The Windows Hook API **intercepts keyboard input at a global level**.
- This allows logging every keypress **before it is processed by an application**.
- The **registry modification ensures the keylogger runs persistently**.
